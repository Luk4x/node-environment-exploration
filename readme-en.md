## 📝 About

This was a project that I used as a testing environment to explore a little about what I was studying at the moment: <b>Nodejs, Expressjs, HTTP methods and params.</b>
<br>

My goal was to create something simple with such technologies, so I thought I'd create a page for [NightRaid](https://akamegakill.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Raid), already with all the main members listed, and with the ability to add new members, update them, or delete them.
Even though it's a little incoherent in a back-end project, in the <code>GET</code> type routes I put a visual response as default, but the <code>.Json</code> can be accessed if the parameter <code>?returnJson=true</code> or <code>"returnJson": true</code> is passed as shown in the video.<br>
A member can be accessed/manipulated either by its <code>array index</code> or by its <code>name</code>.<br>
In general, there is more information in the video and commented in the code about the request patterns, explanations about the routes...
<br><br>
